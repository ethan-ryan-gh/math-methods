    "So another example besides quantum mechanics that uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can be difficult to visualize would be dynamical systems like we see in our circuit courses. Circuits practically live by the law of V=IR where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. Usually, R is constant along the specific path that a current flows. Current and voltage on the other hand, is rarely nice and is dependent on whether parts of the circuit are in series or parrallel. So, There are different currents associated with different voltages across different areas of the circuit with different resistances. This is getting complicated, which is exactly where eigenvalues come into place.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, assuming we have a circuit of 3 currents each with a coefficient of resistance greater than 0. Our mathematical system to solve for the eigenvalues, following IR = V, would be a square matrix of resistance coefficients A multiplied by the current vector 3x1 for 3 currents, is equal to our unknown eigenvalue-voltages V multiplied by our 3x1 current vector. Looks like this A(R) * I(vec) = V(eval) * I(vec), or when solving for eigenvalues: det(A-V(eval)*(Identity Matrix)) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we solved for our eigenvalues, the voltages for each current loop, we solve for the eigenvectors to get the currents I_1, I_2, and I_3 for each value of voltage in the system."
