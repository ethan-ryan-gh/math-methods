Our potential will therefore only be a function of x and y. Let's say we take 100 points, each a distance delta =1 apart in each dimension. These points could span 5 metres, or 5 centimetres, at the end of the day it doesn't matter much. One we have the number of points in each dimension, the mesh grid command will make a lenX x lenY grid of points.\n"
